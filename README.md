Hi, your voice assistant STELLA here for your assistance, how may I help you today..??

Below are my capabilities and shortcomings:

BASIC PRINCIPLE : Speech recognition and speech to text conversion. 
                  Also, the program requires a basic understanding of conditional statements.
                 
WORKING : Voice assistant (STELLA) recognises the words said by user and converts it into lowercase 
          text (for hassle-free experience). Then, it searches for the text in the conditions specified
          by the developer. If the speech/text matches with any of the conditions, it performs the 
          specified task; else it asks the user to repeat the command. If the command is not within
          its potential, it specifies the user to stay tuned and it searches the internet for a result 
          and showcases it to the user.
         
USES : Open a program, play music, write a note, take a picture, call someone, surf the internet, open
       files by specifying their path, hands free typing, send a mail, and many more.
       
LIMITATIONS : STELLA is not implemented with machine learning i.e. it cannot learn things from past user
              experience. Every time you launch it, it starts as new.

Looking forward to help you my friend..

Yours skillfully,
STELLA
